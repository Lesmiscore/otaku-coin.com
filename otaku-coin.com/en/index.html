		<h3>Introduction</h3>
		<p class="largetxt">We have developed a vision for the “Otaku Coin” (based on the ERC20 Standard), a new type of cryptocurrency that will circulate throughout the Japanese content industry in the fields of anime, manga, games, and other content that Japan boasts to the rest of the world. At the moment, we are working toward the possibility of launching our ICO (Initial Coin Offering where a new cryptocurrency is provided) in summer 2018.</p>
		<p class="largetxt">Utilizing blockchain technology, a new mechanism for democratization, the Otaku Coin could be used to connect fans of the anime industry with creators and relevant organizations in a smart and direct way. The Otaku Coin aims to become the currency of Japanese pop culture, facilitating an ecosystem where fans can more easily help preserve the culture they love.</p>
		<p class="largetxt">The main party behind this initiative is the Otaku Coin Preparation Committee consisting of Tokto Otaku Mode (TOM), as well as advisors and partners. While the co-founder and current CEO of TOM will establish the initial framework of the Otaku Coin project, we hypothesize that this initiative will change and develop into a project with decentralized power that matches the fundamentals of blockchain technology.</p>
		<p class="largetxt">We have opened this page to introduce Otaku Coin and gather feedback from fans around the world, members of the Japanese content industry, and other relevant organizations to further improve our project. We would greatly appreciate your honest opinions. We are also currently looking for advisers and partners. If you are interested in joining us and moving forward with Otaku Coin, please <a href="../../external.html?link=https://otakucoin.typeform.com/to/HusWRd" target="_blank">contact us here.</a></p>
		<p class="smalltxt">Please note that this is not equivalent to any type of prospectus or public tender offer. It is not intended for the soliciting of stocks and bonds or encouraging of investments in stocks and bonds. Also, details regarding whether or not this ICO will be launched, how and when it could potentially be launched, and the possibility of offering token sales to Japanese residents have yet to be determined. If this ICO is launched, we intend on designing, promoting, and distributing it in a way that abides all cryptocurrency laws in Japan and around the world. </p>

				<img src="../common/images/obj_image.png" alt="Take a moment to imagine...">
				<h4>Take a moment to imagine...</h4>
				<p>A world where fans around the world can visit Japan without exchanging their money for yen.  A world where having no lineups for anime events, no need for cash at merchandise booths, and no need to worry about loose change or exchange rates becomes the norm.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="imageInner">
				<img src="../common/images/obj_image.png" alt="Take a moment to imagine...">
				<h4>Take a moment to imagine...</h4>

			<div class="imageInner">

			<div class="imageInner">

				<h4>Take a moment to imagine...</h4>
				<p>A world where a fan’s regular activities in consuming the content they support or in minor actions - such as sharing a title with a friend - could earn them Otaku Coin. By supporting and contributing to the Japanese content industry, they can earn rewards and use them to purchase merchandise, participate in events, interact with other fans, or make donations to support upcoming series.</p>

		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="content02 content contenttxt content0202">
		<h3>Those who are working in the Japanese content industry, take a moment to imagine...</h3>
		<p>A world where such fan activities can connect directly to the preservation and development of not this cutlure built around your irreplaceable efforts, but also of the entire Japanese content industry. A world where fans can receive appropriate rewards for their activities; where a virtuous cycle in which organizations can continuously support and develop the industry exists.</p>
		<p>With the circulation of Otaku Coin, a new cryptocurrency constructed upon the foundation of decentralized authority, we can make this world a reality. Similar projects launched in the past have either been too small in scale or had its efforts too widely dispersed.</p>
		<p>The plan we have for the Otaku Coin involves will be democratic and decentralized, utilizing technology that is open and fair to be implemented by all members of the Japanese content industry. Our effort is not intended for the profit-generation of any certain organization. In theory, this mission is one that can gather the strength of all Japanese content industry members. Our collective strength will be capable of breathing new life into the industry as well as contributing to the preservation and development of the culture that Japan boasts to the rest of the world.</p>
